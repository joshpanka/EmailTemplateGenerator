# EmailTemplateGenerator

## Purpose
The idea behind the EmailTemplateGenerator is to have a low level clone of the Klaviyo Email Templates tool.  The goal was to allow edit text functionality and the ability save information to localStorage dynamically as the user interacted with the page.

## Setup
1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `node index.js` and navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
